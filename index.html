           I was born and raised in an adventist family. My joy of being an adventist always increases especially when i read the bible
           My parents helped us grow with a friendly life and this has enabled us to live a life with good friends
           in the schools that we have attended and in our villages where i come from.
           Allow me to take you through a list of my family members and friends.
